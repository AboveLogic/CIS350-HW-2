<h1> Travis Post </h1>
<ul>
 <li> I love music and participate heavily in band, specifically marching band.</li>
 <li> I love to play video games, of course, and would probably enjoy designing them.</li>
 <li> I'm interested in IoT security as well as AI, and would like to research both more.</li>
 <li> I'm interested in wireless security and am excited to take a class on it next semester</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p> I have experience with Java, C++, a little with Python, and am currently learning Javascript. <br>
 I feel as though my technical experience is not at the level it should be, so I have started taking <br>
 online supplemental courses to keep my programming skills intact. I have taken several courses on <br>
 Computing Ethics and like to think that I am somewhat knowledgeable on them. </p>
